Instructions for updating the tcl files:

1) inside project run the following
   >write_project_tcl mk_prj_new.tcl
2) best to compare this to the previous tcl and modify as necessary.
   The bd related stuff should probably be removed from the tcl script?
3) run the following:
   >write_bd_tcl mk_bd_new.tcl
4) this file should be ok to just overwrite the existing mk_bd.tcl file
5) do a quick check to make sure project can be regenerated from scratch


NOTE: The output script is the biggest garbage ever and all paths for a clean import of source files form a given folder must be manually adjusted.



Instructions for creating project from scratch:

1) start vivado_tcl console and change into project_folder directory
2) delete <proj> folder contents (make a cleanup script for this someday)
3) run >source mk_proj.tcl
4) go to <proj> folder and open newly created project
   (Note: you may need to make sure project is targeting the correct part!)
5) at tcl console in project run:
   >source mk_bd.tcl
6) regenerate output products for bd design
7) create wrapper for bd design (this should be something instantiated by HDL already in the design)
