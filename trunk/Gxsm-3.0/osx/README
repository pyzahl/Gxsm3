This document briefly describes how to build and package gedit for OS X.

Building gedit for OS X
=============================================================================
Please see build/README for more details on building gedit


Making a gedit bundle
=============================================================================

You can make a gedit bundle (i.e. a gedit.app) with a script provided by
gedit.

    ./make bundle

Note that in order for this to succeed, you will need to have built gedit
successfully before. If successful, you will now have a gedit.app bundle
in this directory. Similarly, if you want to build the final dmg image,
you can use:

    ./make dmg

Again, for this to succeed you first need to have successfully built the
bundle.
