==================================================

Porting to Grid and new gxsm3 internal BuildParam helper -- pending tasks:
- pending: old SR-SDT/SP2 GUI


Note to self -- remove old/obsolete entries and reset to defaults:
to clean dconf database and reset run as user:
dconf reset -f /org/gnome/gxsm3/



current work in progress:
- DSP Control (MK3 HwI), implementing new GUI simplification scheme via config mode, FB tab done -- testing -- done.
   ... optimize/discuss "config-mode" Widgets, hide FB switch, ...? hide IIR, ICross, ...?, all of Scan Char frame??
   ... mixer channels, blend out set to "OFF" channels austomatically in non config mode -- fix mode switch crash issue/manage
   ... in non config mode show scale for setpoint
   ???... have a "setup" or "optimize" mode/level for config widgets
   ... LM (VP Prog tab): color buttons, figure out how, add description for mode field?, simple mode: eliminate RHS fields??
   ... chain CP/CI 100/120%

   --check PAC monitor update, check/complete PAC gschemata, config enty broken, make sure vales getting stored/restored
   xxx--PAC defaults: full phase, allow neg. ampl. ***, 29800Hz, -0.1 - 3V,  0-5V, *** 0.020, +7.5/-41  -140deg, -73/-140 (15Hz) done.

pending ports:
- 3D / GL view -- started, work in progress.... NEEDS MAJOR PORT TO OPEN-GL > V3.1 :( total incompat, not working.


pending solution/reworks:
-> build a analysis clone "gxsm3a" instance with independent session/session manager and gsettings path
-> auto organize Matrix of Plots?!?!?

pending minor issues:
---PROBE FOLDERS/CONTROL:
  -join button state issue
  -recode LM/graphs button?
- Point Obj "Follow" -- new solution for odl problem. Central on/off switch on titlebar. May add new tip-monitor/move/grab object/life-indicator
- View2D sidepane controls reworked, pending: OSD xy, SelectNC-Vars, Arrow/..size --> gsettings // issues with show-probe checkbox(es)/crashes -- check,fix!
- Profile View: Cursors/DnD pending
- minor left overs of h/vboxes and packing in dialogs... -- non critical, works fine but should be done as officially obsoleted.
  --> smart manage window position???
-- PCS is NOT yet updating non user set values -- akak file nunber aut oadvance, client settings, remote...

Major upcoming task:
- testing and validation, creating a test procedute/list for
  - core
  - math plugins
  - HwI plugin(s)
- Manual, embeded manual code reviewing/updating


Testing, Issues found, Ideas:
- Red/Blue-Line Profile Color List [swap order]
- RedLine Profile ==> [option?] overlay/underlay/below scan view 2D -- done, works (linked to 2d profile, can be hidden), evaluating...

- DSP-Control/Graphs -> add clear Coulmns/divers

{crash w auto-plot at VP start ??? on some machines only -- odd stuff again -- using total new update/plot schme now as gtk3 suggests????}

- Window Pos Management -- issue with size resore if config/normal mode!! [small/big] -- Window manager interferse stupidly :( :( o[

Low Priority:
- Make possibel to adjust rotation live while scanning -- just liek "move", but hi-level, slowly... ???
