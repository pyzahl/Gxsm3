==================================================

Porting to Grid and new gxsm3 internal BuildParam helper -- pending tasks:
- pending: old SR-STD/SP2 GUI


Note to self -- remove old/obsolete entries and reset to defaults:
to clean dconf database and reset run as user:
$$ dconf reset -f /org/gnome/gxsm3/

to debug glib,... messages:
$$ G_DEBUG=fatal_warnings gdb gxsm3


current work in progress, optimizing, ideas:
- DSP Control (MK3 HwI):
   ... implementing new GUI simplification scheme via config mode, FB tab done -- testing -- done.
   ... optimize/discuss "config-mode" Widgets, hide FB switch, ...? hide IIR, ICross, ...?, all of Scan Char frame??
   ... mixer channels, blend out set to "OFF" channels automatically in non config mode -- fix mode switch crash issue/manage => see below gtk3.22 bug/issue ??
       --> need to manage/save/restore mixing mode, so far not managed!!
   ... in non config mode show scale for setpoint
   ???... have a "setup" or "optimize" mode/level for config widgets
   ... LM (VP Prog tab): color buttons, figure out how, add description for mode field?, simple mode: eliminate RHS fields?? => dynamic CSS
   ... chain CP/CI 100/120%
   ... Probe/Graphs -- issue with reading/setting/updating default Signal Source Channels
   ... read/sync V-XYZ from Smart-Piezo-Drive via USB link automatically!
- DSP Mover:
   ... issue with Ampl and GPIO defaults at startup not taking effect, need to update numbers after restart ?!?
   
pending ports:
- 3D / GL view -- started, work in progress.... NEEDS MAJOR PORT TO OPEN-GL > V3.1 :( total incompat, not working. Neither Gxsm-2
- View: OSD objects missing

pending solution/reworks:
-> build a analysis clone "gxsm3a" instance with independent session/session manager and gsettings path
-> auto organize Matrix of Plots?!?!?

pending (old) fixed/issues:
-> Im/-Export Scan plugins: proper file dialog load/save, free filename!! => see WIP as example (fixed)

pending minor issues/ideas:
- probe graph, signal button list for source not updating correctly label??
---PROBE FOLDERS/CONTROL:
  -recode LM/graphs button?
- red/blue showline -- fix color order to logic left-right -> new-old (old-new currently)
- Point Obj "Follow" -- new solution for old problem. Central on/off switch on titlebar. May add new tip-monitor/move/grab object/life-indicator
- Profile View: Cursors/DnD pending
- minor left overs of h/vboxes and packing in dialogs... -- non critical, works fine but should be done as officially obsoleted.
  --> smart manage window position???
-- PCS is NOT yet updating non user set values -- ak file number auto advance, client settings, remote...

External/glib/gtk related issues:
- https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=771242  ComboBoxText problem causes:
(gxsm3:31920): Gdk-CRITICAL **: gdk_window_get_window_type: assertion 'GDK_IS_WINDOW (window)' failed


Major upcoming task:
- Manual updates, embeded manual code reviewing/updating
- Website

Testing, Issues found, Ideas:
- RedLine Profile ==> [option?] overlay/underlay/below scan view 2D -- done, works (linked to 2d profile, can be hidden), evaluating...
- DSP-Control/Graphs -> add clear Coulmns/divers
- Life rotate scan while scanning -> make work (kind or rot/arc move to via slow adjust matrix)!
- implement Z-adjuster (manual Z offset if FB=OFF)
- window manager -- any way to force window positioning?? Ignoring/default/auto if not fit/overlap currently.
  Per default the (any??) window-manager is free to ignore window positioning request -- and does.
  * note: you can watch the gxsm manages/stored window coordinated via dconf...
- graphs -- add color/shade/divider for colums
- issue with Mixer - Mode Change (OFF/LIN/LOG/..), odd behavior to random crash ?!?! => gtk 3.22 combo-box issue -- see above
- SLS: may NOT restore last vales??

Scripts:
- spm_control/tune scope -- adjust defaults
- better icons

Bug Report Log:
-> {crash w auto-plot at VP start ??? on some machines only -- odd stuff again -- using total new update/plot schme now as gtk3 suggests????}
-> Defaults for Amp/GPIO in Mover-Auto Tab needs user update to take effect after 1st start ?? unclear.
-> View2D sidepane controls reworked, pending: OSD xy, SelectNC-Vars, Arrow/..size --> gsettings // issues with show-probe checkbox(es)/crashes -- check,fix!

Low Priority, new ideas, ...:
- Red/Blue-Line Profile Color List [swap order]
- Window Pos Management -- issue with size resore if config/normal mode!! [small/big] -- Window manager interferse stupidly :( :( o[
- Make possibel to adjust rotation live while scanning -- just liek "move", but hi-level, slowly... ???
